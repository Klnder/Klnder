:computer: In 2023 I did 2 bootcamps of 13 weeks each to swap career: Tech Educators and NortCoders. In this bootcamps I learnt fundamentals of developing full stack PERN applications (PostGresql, Express, React, Node) and MERN applications (MongoDB, Express, React, Node). I am now looking for a first position to keep learning and develop my skills.

:mortar_board: Graduated in 2018 at ISEN in France with engineering degree. Learn fundamentals of multiple langages of development and get some experiences working in Tech companies such as Sopra Steria and Orange.

Actually Working on : Learning Vue, Developing my skills with Typescript and Tailwind.
